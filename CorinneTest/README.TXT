This was my ramp-up project for my internship with myStrength. The goal of the app was to generate a list of people of random length.
People in the list have randomly generated ages, birthdates, genders, and Zodiac signs. The app shows a person's index in the list, days alive, months alive, and an option to make a new list.
Working on this project involved logic for creating people and list, learning iOS & Android specific programming, as well as learning and utilizing design patterns (factory, singleton, extenstions).
